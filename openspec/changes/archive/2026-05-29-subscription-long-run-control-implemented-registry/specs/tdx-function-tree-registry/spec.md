## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE lifecycle material status SHALL be explicitly bounded

The FUNCTION_TREE registry SHALL allow lifecycle-related feature nodes to be marked implemented when their evidence, tests, and boundaries describe the implemented lifecycle surface without implying downstream runtime availability.

#### Scenario: Subscription long-run control nodes are implemented with bounded evidence

- **WHEN** B-16 and E-09 cite persisted start requests, explicit restart, restart preflight, restart observation, bounded restart backoff, supervisor tick/run, supervisor daemon controls, statefile ownership diagnostics, lifecycle readiness, diagnostics/runbook projections, tests, and OpenSpec evidence
- **THEN** B-16 and E-09 MAY be registered as `[已实现]`
- **AND** their boundaries MUST state that the implemented surface is explicit operator-managed subscription watch lifecycle control and diagnostics
- **AND** their boundaries MUST NOT imply automatic production recovery, live TongDaXin provider availability, broker readiness, trading readiness, workflow execution, or a complete provider lifecycle guarantee.

#### Scenario: Subscription long-run implemented status remains isolated

- **WHEN** B-16 and E-09 are registered as `[已实现]`
- **THEN** D-07, D-08, E-11, and other feature nodes MUST retain their own explicit statuses, evidence, and boundaries.
