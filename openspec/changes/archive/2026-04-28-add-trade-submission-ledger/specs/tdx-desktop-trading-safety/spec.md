## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stable desktop trade workflows SHALL expose normalized trade safety metadata
The system SHALL attach a stable `trade_safety` object to stable desktop trade workflow results so callers can reason about operational risk without parsing free-form messages.

#### Scenario: Successful trade returns normalized safety metadata
- **WHEN** a caller executes a stable desktop trade workflow through `TdxTradeManager`
- **THEN** the result `data` MUST include `trade_safety`
- **AND** `trade_safety` MUST include a stability grade, side-effect grade, submission-key field, risk-gate summary, and idempotency summary
