# tdx-function-tree-registry Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change function-tree-registry-validator. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE registry SHALL be mechanically validatable

The repository SHALL maintain `FUNCTION_TREE.md` as a single feature registry whose rows explicitly separate status, evidence, and boundary.

#### Scenario: D-07 PingAn input coverage rollup evidence stays bounded

- **WHEN** D-07 cites PingAn bundle input coverage status count evidence
- **THEN** D-07 MUST remain `[部分实现]`
- **AND** the D-07 boundary MUST state that the coverage counts are read-only, non-executing catalog summary evidence
- **AND** the row MUST NOT imply catalog run execution, broker readiness, safety approval, or complete desktop exception coverage.

### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE registry SHALL validate cited OpenSpec evidence

The FUNCTION_TREE registry validator SHALL verify that OpenSpec change ids cited
as evidence in feature rows resolve to checked-in active or archived OpenSpec
change material.

#### Scenario: Feature row cites archived OpenSpec evidence

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites `OpenSpec `some-change``
- **AND** `openspec/changes/archive/<date>-some-change/` exists
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST accept that evidence reference

#### Scenario: Feature row cites active OpenSpec evidence

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites `OpenSpec `some-change``
- **AND** `openspec/changes/some-change/.openspec.yaml` exists
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST accept that evidence reference

#### Scenario: Feature row cites missing OpenSpec evidence

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites an OpenSpec change id that does not exist as an active or archived change
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST fail with the row id and missing change id

### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE registry SHALL validate explicit local evidence paths

The FUNCTION_TREE registry validator SHALL verify that explicit, literal repository-local paths cited as evidence in feature rows exist as checked-in files or directories, while ignoring prose, commands, symbols, glob patterns, and other non-path evidence.

#### Scenario: Feature row cites existing local evidence paths

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites literal repository-local paths such as `tests/test_function_tree_registry.py` or `scripts/validate_function_tree_registry.py`
- **AND** those paths exist under the repository root
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST accept those evidence references

#### Scenario: Feature row cites missing local evidence path

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites a literal repository-local path such as `tests/missing_registry_test.py`
- **AND** that path does not exist under the repository root
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST fail with the row id and missing path

#### Scenario: Feature row cites non-literal evidence

- **WHEN** a feature row evidence cell cites non-path evidence such as function names, command examples, OpenSpec ids, or globbed paths such as `runtime/trade-audits/*`
- **THEN** the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator MUST NOT require those values to exist as literal repository paths

### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE registry validator SHALL expose JSON report output

The FUNCTION_TREE registry validator SHALL expose an opt-in JSON report for machine consumers while preserving the default text output and exit-code semantics.

#### Scenario: Maintainer requests successful JSON report

- **WHEN** a maintainer runs the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator with `--json` against a valid repository root
- **THEN** the validator MUST print a JSON object to stdout
- **AND** the JSON object MUST include `valid`, `row_count`, `status_counts`, `problem_count`, and `errors`
- **AND** `valid` MUST be true, `problem_count` MUST be `0`, and `errors` MUST be empty

#### Scenario: Maintainer requests failing JSON report

- **WHEN** a maintainer runs the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator with `--json` against an invalid registry
- **THEN** the validator MUST return the same non-zero exit code it would return in text mode
- **AND** the JSON object MUST include the validation errors in `errors`
- **AND** stderr MUST remain empty so machine consumers can read the report from a single stream

#### Scenario: Maintainer omits JSON flag

- **WHEN** a maintainer runs the FUNCTION_TREE registry validator without `--json`
- **THEN** the existing compact text summary and stderr error output MUST remain unchanged

### Requirement: FUNCTION_TREE lifecycle material status SHALL be explicitly bounded

The FUNCTION_TREE registry SHALL allow lifecycle-related feature nodes to be marked implemented when their evidence, tests, and boundaries describe the implemented lifecycle surface without implying downstream runtime availability.

#### Scenario: Subscription long-run control nodes are implemented with bounded evidence

- **WHEN** B-16 and E-09 cite persisted start requests, explicit restart, restart preflight, restart observation, bounded restart backoff, supervisor tick/run, supervisor daemon controls, statefile ownership diagnostics, lifecycle readiness, diagnostics/runbook projections, tests, and OpenSpec evidence
- **THEN** B-16 and E-09 MAY be registered as `[已实现]`
- **AND** their boundaries MUST state that the implemented surface is explicit operator-managed subscription watch lifecycle control and diagnostics
- **AND** their boundaries MUST NOT imply automatic production recovery, live TongDaXin provider availability, broker readiness, trading readiness, workflow execution, or a complete provider lifecycle guarantee.

#### Scenario: Subscription long-run implemented status remains isolated

- **WHEN** B-16 and E-09 are registered as `[已实现]`
- **THEN** D-07, D-08, E-11, and other feature nodes MUST retain their own explicit statuses, evidence, and boundaries.
