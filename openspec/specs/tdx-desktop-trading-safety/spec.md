# tdx-desktop-trading-safety Specification

## Purpose

定义稳定桌面交易结果中的安全治理契约，包括风险门、submission key 和 idempotency 摘要。
## Requirements
### Requirement: Stable desktop trade workflows SHALL expose normalized trade safety metadata
The system SHALL attach a stable `trade_safety` object to stable desktop trade workflow results so callers can reason about operational risk without parsing free-form messages.

#### Scenario: Successful trade returns normalized safety metadata
- **WHEN** a caller executes a stable desktop trade workflow through `TdxTradeManager`
- **THEN** the result `data` MUST include `trade_safety`
- **AND** `trade_safety` MUST include a stability grade, side-effect grade, submission-key field, risk-gate summary, and idempotency summary

### Requirement: Stable desktop trade workflows SHALL preserve an optional submission key
The system SHALL preserve an optional caller-supplied `submission_key` across result payloads and persisted trade artifacts.

#### Scenario: Caller provides submission key
- **WHEN** a caller executes a stable desktop trade workflow with a `submission_key`
- **THEN** the result `data.trade_safety.submission_key` MUST equal the caller value
- **AND** the persisted last-order state payload and append-only event row MUST contain the same key

### Requirement: Stable desktop trade workflows SHALL reject failed pre-trade risk gates before UI side effects
The system SHALL reject invalid requests before any desktop automation side effects execute.

#### Scenario: Invalid order request fails before desktop execution
- **WHEN** a caller submits an invalid stable desktop order request
- **THEN** the workflow MUST return an invalid-request style result
- **AND** the desktop execution routine MUST NOT be called

#### Scenario: Submitted price exceeds caller ceiling
- **WHEN** a caller supplies `max_price` and the requested order price is greater than that ceiling
- **THEN** the workflow MUST return an invalid-request style result
- **AND** the desktop execution routine MUST NOT be called

### Requirement: PingAn live trading implementation SHALL be gated by safety and acceptance evidence

Before PingAn buy/sell/confirm_current/submit_once paths are claimed implemented, the implementation SHALL provide evidence for live-provider capability ownership, explicit safety checks, desktop result/exception handling, audit persistence, and acceptance verification.

#### Scenario: Live trading promotion requires ordered gates

- **WHEN** a later change attempts to promote D-07 or D-08 to `[已实现]`
- **THEN** the change MUST provide provider/broker ownership evidence
- **AND** safety evidence for max price or equivalent guardrails, submission-key/idempotency, and explicit approval semantics
- **AND** desktop lifecycle evidence for dialog readiness, result popups, exception popups, timeout/retry handling, and process/window ownership
- **AND** audit evidence for success/failure/rejection/exception paths
- **AND** automated fake/replay verification plus documented manual/live acceptance evidence where the real environment is required.

#### Scenario: Read-only catalog evidence cannot satisfy live trading safety gates

- **WHEN** evidence only comes from catalog validate, catalog plan, or catalog preview output
- **THEN** the evidence MUST NOT satisfy live trading safety, readiness, or acceptance gates.
